librsync is a Dart library to calculate differences between two files without having access to both files at the same time. Although it is a rewrite, it should be compatible with the C library of the same name.

It is feature complete and has tests. I have not tested performance, but even if performance is lacking, I'm not sure it can be improved much in Dart.

See the tests or rdiff for example usage.
